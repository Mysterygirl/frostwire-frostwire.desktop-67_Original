HttpCore Examples

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/httpcore/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpGet.java}Basic HTTP GET}}
    
    This example demonstrates how to execute a series of simple HTTP GET requests.

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/httpcore/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpPost.java}Basic HTTP POST}}
    
    This example demonstrates how to execute a series of simple HTTP POST requests that enclose entity 
    content of various types: a string, a byte array, an arbitrary input stream.  

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/httpcore/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpServer.java}Basic HTTP server}}
    
    This is an example of a simple but fully functional HTTP/1.1 server written with only a few dozen 
    lines of Java code.

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/httpcore-nio/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/NHttpServer.java}Basic non-blocking HTTP server}}
    
    This example demonstrates the use of HttpCore NIO extensions to build a non-blocking HTTP/1.1 server.

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/httpcore-nio/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/NHttpClient.java}Basic non-blocking HTTP client}}
    
    This example demonstrates how HttpCore NIO can be used to execute multiple HTTP requests using
    only one I/O thread.

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/httpcore-nio/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/NHttpClientConnManagement.java}Management of non-blocking client connections}}
    
    This example demonstrates how to manage reuse of persistent client connections using HttpCore NIO. 

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/httpcore-nio/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/NHttpSSLServer.java}Basic non-blocking HTTPS server}}
    
    This example demonstrates the use of HttpCore NIO extensions to build a non-blocking HTTPS/1.1 server.

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/contrib/src/main/java/org/apache/http/contrib/compress/}Content compression}}

    These request/response interceptors implement client- and server-side content
    compression/decompression logic. They can simply be added to any existing HTTP processor to enable it for 
    content compression. If you use an IoC container to initialize HTTP processors, you do not even 
    have to recompile your application.

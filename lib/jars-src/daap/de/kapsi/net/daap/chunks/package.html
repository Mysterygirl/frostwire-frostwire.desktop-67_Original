Miscellaneous base classes of so called chunks. A chunk is a tagged value and is
either really a value or a container for other chunks. As a DAAP user (developer)
you shouldn't have to deal with these classes directly. You can find actual 
implementations of these classes in {@see de.kapsi.net.daap.chunks.impl}.

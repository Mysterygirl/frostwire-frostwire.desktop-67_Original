<p>Provides classes for associating applications with file types and accessing a  
registered file type association.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every desktop allows the user to view files with the associated applications. Usually a desktop comes with a registry that allows the user to 
associate applications with file types. An association includes information like 
a MIME type, file extensions, and actions that could be applied to the file 
type. By accessing the association information, the desktop could invoke the appropriate 
applications to handle a file, display an URL or send an email.

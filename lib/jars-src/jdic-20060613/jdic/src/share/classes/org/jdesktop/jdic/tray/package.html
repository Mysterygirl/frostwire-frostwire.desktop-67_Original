<p>Provides classes for creating tray icons on the desktop.</p> 

<p>A tray icon can have a caption (text), an icon, and a menu associated with it. It can also have a tool tip that is displayed when the mouse hovers over the tray icon. To get animation in the notification tray, use an animated GIF for the icon. Tray menus are Swing menus, which enables them to contain icons (unlike Windows and Gnome tray menus) and have either a cross-platform look and feel or the system look and feel.</p>   

<p>  On Windows, the tray icon is created in the System Tray Area. On Gnome/Unix, 
it's created in the Notification Area.</p>

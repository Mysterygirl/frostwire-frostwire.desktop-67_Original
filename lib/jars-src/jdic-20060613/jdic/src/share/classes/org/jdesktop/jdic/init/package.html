<p>Provides an initialization manager for JDIC to set the environment variables or initialize 
the set up for native libraries and executable files.</p>  

<p>There are 3 modes of operation: Java Web Start, file system, and .jar file. When using 
Java Web Start, please specify a .jar file (<code>jdic-native.jar</code>) with the&nbsp;native libraries for your platform to be loaded by 
Java Web Start in your JNPL. This class will find the unjar'ed native libraries and executables, and use&nbsp;them directly. If not in WebStart, the system will expect the native libraries to be located  
in directory at the root of the classpath or .jar containing this class. </p>

<p>Provides an AWT component to enable the embedding of a web browsing component into Java applications and applets.</p>   

<p>The embedded browsing component enables Java applications and applets to 
access web browsing capabilities, provided by full-featured system browsers 
(Internet Explorer or Mozilla on Windows, and Mozilla on Linux/Solaris).</p>  
<p>The capabilities include creating a browser window, web content rendering, navigation, a basic history mechanism, and progress notification.&nbsp;</p> 

<p>  
Usage of the component is very much like a Swing <code>JEditorPane</code> component.</p>

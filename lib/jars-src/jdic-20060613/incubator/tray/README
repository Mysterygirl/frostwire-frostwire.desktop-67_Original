Tray Icon API README
--------------------
The Preliminary implementation for System tray functionality.
Version 0.1

The Tray Icon API is a set of APIs to create tray icons on the desktop. 
A tray icon can have a caption (text), an icon and a menu associated with it. 
It can also have a tooltip associated that is displayed when the mouse hovers 
over the tray icon. The associated tray menus are Swing Menus, so that they 
can take on a standard L&F or the system L&F. The associated icon could be 
animated icons. To get animation in the notification tray is to use an animated 
GIF. The associated menus can also have icons as well, unlike Windows and Gnome 
tray menus.

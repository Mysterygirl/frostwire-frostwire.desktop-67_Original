JDIC SystemInfo README
---------------------------------

This is the Preliminary implementation of the JDIC SystemInfo API.

The SystemInfo API allows access to properties native to the host operating
system, such as user idle time and desktop lock state. The implementation for
obtaining such properties varies widely from OS to OS and desktop environment
to desktop environment; this package hopes to consolidate their implementation
in a runtime environment so code can be easily re-used across multiple platforms.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
- Windows 2000/XP/2003 
- Most *nix platforms running an XWindows implementation (Linux, Solaris)

System Requirements 
- J2SE v1.4.2 or greater (available at http://java.com/) 

Building the Source
-------------------
To build the API from source, your system must meet the following
requirements:

    * JDK 1.4 or greater, available from http://java.sun.com/
    * Ant 1.5.1 or greater, available from http://ant.apache.org/
    * A C++ compiler (such as GCC or C++) or cross-compiler

To build the API:

    * Run 'ant buildall' to build the API and demos.

Support
-------
Support for SystemInfo is provided by the Java community on the
JDIC project on java.net.

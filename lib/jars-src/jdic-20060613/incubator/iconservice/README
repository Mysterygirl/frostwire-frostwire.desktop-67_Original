JDIC Incubator Iconservice README
---------------------------------

This is the Preliminary implementation of the JDIC IconService.

The IconService hides the Operating System dependencies for retrieving an 
icon.  The most interesting place for its use is to retrieve the icon specified by the 
org.jdesktop.jdic.filetypes.Association.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
- WinME/NT/2000/XP/2003 
- Any Unix platform supporting Freedesktop icon specification (Linux, Solaris)

System Requirements 
- J2SE v1.4.2 or greater (available at http://java.com/) 
- JDIC 0.7 or greater (available at https://jdic.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList)

Building the Source
-------------------
To build the API from source, your system must meet the following
requirements:

    * JDK 1.4 or greater, available from http://java.sun.com/
    * Ant 1.5.1 or greater, available from http://ant.apache.org/

To build the API:

    * Run 'ant buildall' to build the API and demos.

The demo applications in this directory showcase JDIC iconservice 
incubator functionality.  These samples are slightly modified versions of 
the JDIC samples of the same name.  

To compile these applications, make sure that both the jdic.jar and 
jdic-icon.jar is available in the classpath or ${JRE_HOME}/lib/ext 
directory.  

To run a sample applications, the CLASSPATH must contain the sample 
directory.  Additionally, both the jdic shared library (libjdic.so for 
Unix / jdic.dll for Windows) and the icon service incubator shared library 
(libjdic_icon.so for Unix / jdic_icon.dll for Windows) must be available 
on the path or the directory specified by the java system property 
java.library.path.

    <title>HTTP authentication</title>
    <para>HttpClient provides full support for authentication schemes defined by the HTTP standard
        specification. HttpClient's authentication framework can also be extended to support
        non-standard authentication schemes such as <literal>NTLM</literal> and
            <literal>SPNEGO</literal>.</para>
    <section>
        <title>User credentials</title>
        <para>Any process of user authentication requires a set of credentials that can be used to
            establish user identity. In the simplest form user crednetials can be just a user name /
            password pair. <classname>UsernamePasswordCredentials</classname> represents a set of
            credentials consisting of a security principal and a password in clear text. This
            implementation is sufficient for standard authentication schemes defined by the HTTP
            standard specification.</para>

        <title>Authentication schemes</title>
        <para>The <interfacename>AuthScheme</interfacename> interface represents an abstract
            challenge-response oriented authentication scheme. An authentication scheme is expected
            to support the following functions:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Parse and process the challenge sent by the target server in response to
                    request for a protected resource.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Provide properties of the processed challenge: the authentication scheme type
                    and its parameters, such the realm this authentication scheme is applicable to,
                    if available</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Generate authorization string for the given set of credentials and the HTTP
                    request in response to the actual authorization challenge.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Please note authentication schemes may be stateful involving a series of
            challenge-response exchanges.</para>
        <para>HttpClient ships with several <interfacename>AuthScheme</interfacename>
            implementations:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <formalpara>
                    <title>Basic:</title>
                    <para>Basic authentication scheme as defined in RFC 2617. This authentication
                        scheme is insecure, as the credentials are transmitted in clear text.
                        Despite its insecurity Basic authentication scheme is perfectly adequate if
                        used in combination with the TLS/SSL encryption.</para>
                </formalpara>
                <formalpara>
                    <title>Digest</title>
                    <para>Digest authentication scheme as defined in RFC 2617. Digest authentication
                        scheme is significantly more secure than Basic and can be a good choice for
                        those applications that do not want the overhead of full transport security
                        through TLS/SSL encryption.</para>
                </formalpara>
                <formalpara>
                    <title>NTLM:</title>
                    <para>NTLM is a proprietary authentication scheme developed by Microsoft and
                        optimized for Windows platforms. NTLM is believed to be more secure than
                        Digest. This scheme is supported only partially and requires an external
                        NTLM engine. For details please refer to the
                            <literal>NTLM_SUPPORT.txt</literal> document included with HttpClient
                        distributions.</para>

    <section>
        <title>HTTP authentication parameters</title>
        <para>These are parameters that be used to customize HTTP authentication process and
            behaviour of individual authentication schemes:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <formalpara>
                    <title>'http.protocol.handle-authentication':</title>
                    <para>defines whether authentication should be handled automatically. This
                        parameter expects a value of type <classname>java.lang.Boolean</classname>.
                        If this parameter is not set HttpClient will handle authentication
                        automatically.</para>

                <formalpara>
                    <title>'http.auth.credential-charset':</title>
                    <para>defines the charset to be used when encoding user credentials. This
                        parameter expects a value of type <literal>java.lang.String</literal>. If
                        this parameter is not set <literal>US-ASCII</literal> will be used.</para>
                </formalpara>

    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Authentication scheme registry</title>
        <para>HttpClient maintains a registry of available authentication scheme using
                <classname>AuthSchemeRegistry</classname> class. The following schemes are
            registered per default:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <formalpara>
                    <title>Basic:</title>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Please note <literal>NTLM</literal> scheme is <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> registered per
            default. For details on how to enable <literal>NTLM</literal> support please refer to
            the <literal>NTLM_SUPPORT.txt</literal> document included with HttpClient
            distributions.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Credentials provider</title>
        <para>Credentials providers are intended to maintain a set of user credentials and to be
            able to produce user credentials for a particular authentication scope. Authentication
            scope consists of a host name, a port number, a realm name and an authentication scheme
            name. When registering credentials with the credentials provider one can provide a wild
            card (any host, any port, any realm, any scheme) instead of a concrete attribute value.
            The credentials provider is then expected to be able to find the closest match for a
            particular scope if the direct match cannot be found.</para>
        <para>HttpClient can work with any physical representation of a credentials provider that
            implements the <interfacename>CredentialsProvider</interfacename> interface. The default
                <interfacename>CredentialsProvider</interfacename> implementation called
                <classname>BasicCredentialsProvider</classname> is a simple implementation backed by
            a <classname>java.util.HashMap</classname>.</para>

        <title>HTTP authentication and execution context</title>
        <para>HttpClient relies on the <classname>AuthState</classname> class to keep track of
            detailed information about the state of the authentication process. HttpClient creates
            two instances of <classname>AuthState</classname> in the course of HTTP request
            execution: one for target host authentication and another one for proxy authentication.
            In case the target server or the proxy require user authentication the respective
                <classname>AuthScope</classname> instance will be populated with the
                <classname>AuthScope</classname>, <interfacename>AuthScheme</interfacename> and
                <interfacename>Crednetials</interfacename> used during the authentication process.
            The <classname>AuthState</classname> can be examined in order to find out what kind of
            authentication was requested, whether a matching
                <interfacename>AuthScheme</interfacename> implementation was found and whether the
            credentials provider managed to find user credentials for the given authentication
            scope.</para>
        <para>In the course of HTTP request execution HttpClient adds the following authentication
            related objects to the execution context:</para>

                        authentication scheme registry. The value of this attribute set in the local

        <title>Preemptive authentication</title>
        <para>HttpClient does not support preemptive authentication out of the box, because if
            misused or used incorrectly the preemptive authentication can lead to significant
            security issues, such as sending user credentials in clear text to an unauthorized third
            party. Therefore, users are expected to evaluate potential benefits of preemptive
            authentication versus security risks in the context of their specific application
            environment and are required to add support for preemptive authentication using standard
            HttpClient extension mechanisms such as protocol interceptors.</para>
        <para>This is an example of a simple protocol interceptor that preemptively introduces an
            instance of <classname>BasicScheme</classname> to the execution context, if no
            authentication has been attempted yet. Please note that this interceptor must be added
            to the protocol processing chain before the standard authentication interceptors.</para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
HttpRequestInterceptor preemptiveAuth = new HttpRequestInterceptor() {
    
    public void process(
            final HttpRequest request,

            // Obtain credentials matching the target host
            Credentials creds = credsProvider.getCredentials(authScope);

This folder is here for testing purposes. It's not going to be included when we build frostwire.
FrostWire will be able to recreate this folder when it makes a check for a healthy environment for plugins
to be installed.

If you want to test the plugin environment run ./runPluginsTests on the gui/ folder.

--
If you want to recreate jars out of the sub folders in this folder.
Here are the commands.

jar -cvf twoScriptsTest.jar twoScriptsTest/*
jar -cvf brooklyn.jar brooklyn/*
